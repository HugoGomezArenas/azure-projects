# Deploying a Linux Virtual Machine in Azure with Terraform

- WIP

Welcome to my Azure Projects repository! This repository serves as an example of using Terraform to provision a Linux virtual machine (VM) in Microsoft Azure.

## Overview

This guide will walk you through deploying the VM using Terraform scripts. Additionally, this repository is part of an initiative where I am compiling a series of projects and proof of concepts. These resources are intended to serve as practical examples and references for anyone interested in learning Azure.
